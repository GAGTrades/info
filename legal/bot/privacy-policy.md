# GAGTrades Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** `5:32 AM July 9th, 2025 (GMT+3)`

This Privacy Policy explains how we, the developers of GAGTrades (gagtrades.com), handle information in relation to our Discord bot ("the Bot"). We are committed to user privacy. This bot is designed to collect the absolute minimum data required to function.

## 1. No Collection of Personal User Data

**GAGTrades does not collect, request, or store any personal information about Discord users.**

We do not store your Discord username, discriminator, user ID, avatar, email address, or any messages you send that do not directly involve the configuration of the Bot.

## 2. Information We Do Collect

The only information the Bot collects and stores is related to the servers (guilds) in which it operates. This includes:

- **Guild ID:** Your server's unique Discord ID. This is necessary to associate the settings with the correct server.
- **Guild-Specific Settings:** The configuration options that a server administrator sets for the Bot. For example, this includes the Notifiers that you set up for the bot using the `/notifiers` command and its subcommands.

This information is strictly used to provide the Bot's services to that specific server and is not linked to any individual user.

## 3. How We Use Information

The guild-specific information we collect is used exclusively to:

- Provide the configured functionality within that server.
- Save settings so they persist if the Bot restarts.
- Troubleshoot technical issues related to a specific server's configuration.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Because we do not collect any personal user data, we have none to share or sell. We will not share, sell, or rent your server's specific configuration data with any third parties.

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

Guild-specific settings are stored for as long as the Bot remains in that server. When the Bot is kicked or banned from a server, all associated settings and the Guild ID are automatically and permanently deleted from our database. A server administrator may also request manual deletion of their server's data at any time by contacting us.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The Bot does not knowingly collect any data from any individual, including children under the age of 13. The use of the Bot is governed by the server administrator, who is expected to operate their server in compliance with Discord's Terms of Service regarding age restrictions.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.

## 8. Contact Us
