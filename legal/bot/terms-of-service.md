# GAGTrades Discord Bot Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** `5:32 AM July 9th, 2025 (GMT+3)`

Welcome to GAGTrades! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the use of the GAGTrades Discord bot ("the Bot"). By adding the Bot to your Discord server ("guild"), you, as the server administrator or authorized user, agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of your server. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not add or use the Bot.

## 1. Description of Service

GAGTrades is a utility bot for the game Grow a Garden on the Discord platform. It allows server administrators to configure specific settings to enable automated content, such as live stock changes from the game. The Bot's functionality is determined entirely by the settings configured for each specific guild. The Bot does not create user profiles, manage virtual economies, or store any user-specific data.

## 2. Administrator Responsibilities

As the person who adds and configures the Bot for a server, you are responsible for its use within that guild. You agree not to:

- Configure the Bot in a way that violates Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.
- Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the Bot's operation for other servers.

You are solely responsible for the settings you apply and the consequences of those settings within your server.

## 3. Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in and to the Bot, including its source code, branding, and all other components, are and will remain the exclusive property of GAGTrades. The Bot is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

## 4. Termination

We reserve the right to prevent the Bot from operating in any specific guild at our sole discretion, with or without notice. This action may be taken if a server is found to be using the Bot in a manner that violates these Terms, is causing technical issues, or for any other reason. Upon termination, all stored configuration settings for that guild will be deleted.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Bot is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the Bot will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that any configurations will be saved indefinitely. The Bot's functionality may change or be discontinued at any time. You use the Bot at your own risk.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, GAGTrades shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data or functionality resulting from (i) your ability or inability to use the Bot; (ii) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any and all guild configuration data stored therein; or (iii) the permanent cessation of the service.

## 7. Changes to the Terms

We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be available. We may notify server owners of significant changes via a Discord announcement in our main server. By continuing to use the Bot after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
